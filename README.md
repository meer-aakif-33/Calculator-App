# Advanced Calculator

An interactive and feature-rich **Advanced Calculator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This calculator supports essential arithmetic operations, advanced functions like square roots and factorials, and includes features such as memory storage and calculation history.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).
- **Advanced Operations**:
  - Square root (√x)
  - Square (x²)
  - Power function (xʸ)
  - Factorial (n!)
- **Memory Functions**:
  - Memory Save (MS)
  - Memory Recall (MR)
- **Calculation History**:
  - Stores up to 10 previous calculations.
  - Allows clearing history when needed.
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Dark-themed design for easy visibility.
  - Responsive layout to fit different screen sizes.
  - Intuitive button layout for seamless interaction.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/advanced-calculator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```sh
   cd advanced-calculator
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in Your Browser**
   - Simply double-click `index.html` or open it in your preferred web browser.

## How to Use

1. **Performing Calculations**:
   - Click on numeric buttons and operators to enter expressions.
   - Click `=` to compute the result.
2. **Using Memory Functions**:
   - `MS` (Memory Save) stores the displayed value.
   - `MR` (Memory Recall) retrieves the saved value.
3. **Advanced Operations**:
   - `√` calculates the square root of the current value.
   - `x²` squares the current value.
   - `xʸ` allows exponentiation.
   - `n!` computes the factorial of a number.
4. **Managing History**:
   - View past calculations in the history section.
   - Click `Clear History` to reset stored calculations.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – For structuring the calculator.
- **CSS3** – For styling the UI with a dark theme.
- **JavaScript** – For calculator logic and interactivity.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan).
- Adding a dark/light mode toggle.
- Supporting keyboard inputs for faster calculations.
- Improving the history section with better UI and export functionality.
